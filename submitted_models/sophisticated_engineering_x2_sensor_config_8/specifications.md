# X2 Config 8
This specifications.md file is a description and proof of virtual model validation for the Sophisticated Engineering X2 Config 8 with Sensor Configuration as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot. This robot may be launched using a `roslaunch` command with the variable name `sophisticated_engineering_x2_sensor_config_8`. 

## Description
This configuration is based on the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot. Die only difference ist that the cone angle of the two cameras and of the lights have been increased. The new cone angle of the cameras is the same as used for the cameras in X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.

## Usage Instructions
The robot can be used in the same manner as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot. 

## Usage Rights
The same Rights are granted for the configuration as for the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. No additional restrictions have to be taken into account for this configuration.

### Cost and Scale
The Sophisticated Engineering X2 Config 8 has the same estimated commercial cost as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. Its weight is the same as for the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. 

### Sensors
This X2 with sensor configuration 8 includes the same sensors as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. Only the cameras have a wider cone angle.

### Control
This X2 Config 8 can be controlled in the same way as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.

### Motion CharacteristicsBased on the tests specified in the DARPA SubT Challenge [Model PreparationGuide](https://subtchallenge.com/\<fix_me\>), this vehicle has the following motion constraint characteristics. 
This configuration has the same motion characteristics as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.

### Endurance Characteristics
This configuration has the same endurcance characteristics as the X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.
