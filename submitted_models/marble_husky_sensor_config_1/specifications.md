# MARBLE Husky Sensor Config 1
This specifications.md file is a description and proof of virtual model validation for the MARBLE Husky with Sensor Configuration 1. This robot may be launched using an ign launch command with the variable name `marble_husky_sensor_config_1`.

## Description
This configuration is based on Clearpath Robotics Husky ground robot. The marble sensor suite is located at the front of the husky and includes stationary sensors and some sensors and a light on a pan/tilt mechanism.  

## Marsupial Configuration
This vehicle has a platform behind it with mechanical grippers (not modeled) that allow for deployment of UAVs. A QAV500 vehicle is the target marsupial vehicle but multiple vehicle platforms are possible and that is represented accordingly here in simulation.

## Usage Instructions
The robot can be used in the same manner as the COSTAR Husky robot.  It accepts twist messages on the cmd_vel topic.  The gimbal can be controlled using the test_gimbal.sh script (in this folder).  There are also scripts to print the current angles from the pan and tilt axes of the gimbal (pan_echo.sh and tilt_echo.sh). 

The gimbal can be controlled via the following topics:
pan_tilt/pan_rate_cmd_double (send a std_msgs/Double message)
pan_tilt/tilt_rate_cmd_double (send a std_msgs/Double message)

The position of the pan and tilt axes can be accessed through the joint_state topic.  The name of each axis is available inside that message, but as of today the pan and tilt can be accessed as follows:
Pan: joint_state/position[4]
Tilt: joint_state/position[5]

## Usage Rights
The same Rights are granted for the configuration as for the COSTAR Husky. No additional restrictions have to be taken into account for this configuration.

### Cost and Scale
The MARBLE Husky has the following estimate commercial cost components:
* Base vehicle: $25,000
* Sensor suite: $12,000
* Compute/Support Electronics: $4,000
* Total: ~ $41,000

Its weight is approximately 85 lbs (two-person heft). 

### Sensors
This MARBLE Husky with sensor configuration 1 includes the following sensors. The specifications for these instruments are provided below in the [Validation Links](#validation_links) section.

The following specific sensors are declared payloads of this vehicle:

* Trossen ScorpionX MX-64 Robot Turret, modeled by JointStateController and JointStatePublisher plugins.
* D435i RGBD Camera (x3), modeled by rgbd_camera plugin
  - 1x fixed, forward-looking
  - 1x fixed, downward-facing at about 45 degrees (for examining terrain)
  - 1x gimballed (on the Trossen turret)
* Ouster 3D Lidar (64 Channel), modeled by gpu_lidar plugin
* Microstrain IMU: 3DM-GX5-25, modeled by imu_sensor plugin.  (located under the 3D lidar, installed at same x,y location as 3D lidar)
- RPLidar S1 Planar Lidar (under the 3D lidar), modeled by gpu_ray plugin
- Vividia HTI-301 LWIR Camera (not modeled because thermal camera not yet supported in simulator) - located on the turret next to the D435i and light.  
* 12 communication breadcrumbs are also available as a payload for this robot in sensor configuration 2.

### Control
This MARBLE Husky is controlled by the DiffDrive plugin.  It accepts twist inputs which drive the vehicle along the x-direction and around the z-axis.  

### Motion Characteristics
Based on the tests specified in the DARPA SubT Challenge [Model Preparation Guide](https://subtchallenge.com/resources/Simulation_Model_Preparation_Guide.pdf), this vehicle has the following motion constraint characteristics:

* _x_ velocity range from -1.0 m/s to 1.0 m/s
* _x_ acceleration range from -3.0 m/s<sup>2</sup> to 3.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>

The constraints can be found in the following locations within the simulation model package:

* `spawner.rb`, lines 23-26

This configuration has the same motion characteristics as the COSTAR husky, except it also has a pan/tilt mechanism which has additional motion characteristics.  We have included a test script in this folder (test_gimbal.sh) which sends pan and tilt commands using ROS topics.  This script assumes you have named your vehicle X1.  

The motion characteristics are the same as the COSTAR husky which has already been modeled.  We were unable to perform additional validation tests due to COVID-19 restrictions.  

### Endurance Characteristics
This configuration has an endurance of approximately 4 hours, but we have limited the model in simulation to have a 1 hour endurance.  We plan to carry out the endurance test characterization but have been prevented from doing so due to the coronavirus measures preventing us from visiting the lab space while preparing these models for simulation.  

### Diversions from Physical Hardware of MARBLE Husky
Computers were installed in the payload area of the husky and these have been roughly modeled (the rail and computer bay are shown in the model.sdf model).  The MARBLE vehicle uses an AMD Ryzen processor (32-core) with 64 GB of RAM.  It has a cooling system as well. 

The endurance and motion characteristics above are approximated to match existing models until model validation data can be provided.

The physical robot has 3 communication breadcrumbs. 12 breadcrumbs are included in sensor configuration 2, which is standardized to match other available models.
