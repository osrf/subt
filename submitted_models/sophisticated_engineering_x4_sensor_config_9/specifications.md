# X4 Config 9
This specifications.md file is a description and proof of virtual model validation for the Sophisticated Engineering X4 Config 9 with Sensor Configuration as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot. This robot may be launched using a `roslaunch` command with the variable name `sophisticated_engineering_x4_sensor_config_9`.

## Description
This configuration is based on the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot. Die only difference is that the cone angle of the lights have been increased to completely illuminate the camera view and that the position of the cameras have been changed to minimize the structure of the copter in the camera view.

## Usage Instructions
The robot can be used in the same manner as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5 robot.

## Usage Rights
The same Rights are granted for the configuration as for the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. No additional restrictions have to be taken into account for this configuration.

### Cost and Scale
The Sophisticated Engineering X4 Config 9 has the same estimated commercial cost as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. Its weight is the same as for the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. 

### Sensors
This X4 with sensor configuration 9 includes the same sensors as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5. Only the positions of the cameras have been changed.

### Control
This X4 Config 9 can be controlled in the same way as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.

### Motion CharacteristicsBased on the tests specified in the DARPA SubT Challenge [Model PreparationGuide](https://subtchallenge.com/\<fix_me\>), this vehicle has the following motion constraint characteristics. 
This configuration has the same motion characteristics as the X4_SENSOR_CONFIG_5.

### Endurance Characteristics
